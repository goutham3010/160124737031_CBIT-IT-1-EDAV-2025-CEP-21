## Environment and Tools Used
- Python
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib

## Summary
This project analyzed vehicle registrations and enrollment statistics in Indian states, highlighting vehicle type and regional disparities. Average registrations were computed across states and vehicle type, and the analysis included vehicle-specific  trends. Visualizations were created to compare increment rates by vehicle type across states for better interpretation. The project demonstrates how data analytics can reveal inequality patterns in vehicle enrollment and prompt targeted interventions.

## Findings
- Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, and Delhi currently lead new vehicle registrations, with Uttar Pradesh projected to have the largest vehicle stock by 2050 (from 29 million in 2023 to 93 million by 2050)
- In the last fiscal year, rural regions posted higher growth rates than urban ones: rural two-wheeler registrations increased by 8.39% vs 6.77% in urban areas; for three-wheelers, rural growth reached 8.7% compared to just 0.28% in cities
- Overall, India's vehicle registration expansion is driven by economic growth, infrastructure improvements, and shifting consumer demand, with rural regions now contributing significantly to new registrations, especially in two- and three-wheeler segments. Urban centers maintain high uptake in commercial and passenger vehicles due to business activity and population density, but overall growth is becoming more balanced across regions and states
